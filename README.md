<h3 align="center">:wrench: Refactor your task management</h3>

<p align="center">
  TaskTree is a free and open-source task manager that leverages the power of data structures to get things done in bunches.
</p>

TaskTree aims to provide the best experience to both users and developers by:

- **New and developer-friendly technology:** TaskTree is built using [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to provide a balance between performance and developer experience.
- **Useful and scalable features:** TaskTree includes a variety of features to help users be more productive that will scale as this project becomes larger.
  <!-- TODO: Actually implement this-->
- **Quick Iteration:** TaskTree uses [**CircleCI**]() for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) so that new features can be shipped quickly and effectively.
